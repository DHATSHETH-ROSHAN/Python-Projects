# Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**! This is a text-based word-guessing game where the objective is to guess the hidden word one letter at a time before you run out of chances. The words are chosen randomly and are names of fruits or vegetables.

## Features:
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of fruits and vegetables.
- Provides hints to help identify the word.
- Tracks and displays the guessed letters.
- Allows users to play multiple rounds until they decide to quit.
- Displays the full word and a win/lose message at the end of each game.

## How to Play:
1. **Start the Game**: When the game begins, a word is selected randomly, and its letters are hidden as underscores (`_`).
2. **Guess Letters**: Enter one letter at a time to guess the word.
   - Correct guesses reveal the corresponding letters in the word.
   - Incorrect guesses reduce your remaining chances.
3. **Hints**: The game provides a hint that the word is the name of a fruit or vegetable.
4. **Win/Lose**: You win if you guess all the letters correctly before running out of chances. If you fail, the full word will be revealed.
5. **Play Again**: After each round, choose whether to play again or exit the game.
