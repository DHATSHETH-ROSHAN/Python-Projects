# Word Guessing Game

This is a simple command-line word guessing game written in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list and the player has to guess the characters of the word. The player has a limited number of guesses, and the goal is to guess the word before running out of attempts.

## Features:
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Allows the user to guess one letter at a time.
- The game provides feedback if the guessed letter is correct or wrong.

2. **Guess the Word**: The game will show the number of characters in the word and you have to guess the letters one by one.
3. **Make Guesses**: You can enter a single letter for each guess. If the letter is part of the word, it will be revealed.
4. **Limited Attempts**: You have a limited number of guesses. If you guess wrong, you lose one chance.
5. **Win or Lose**: You win the game if you guess all the letters in the word before running out of guesses. If you run out of guesses, you lose the game.
